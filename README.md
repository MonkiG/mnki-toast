# MnkiToast

Standalone built in web components toast component

*Component made it for educational purposes*

## Todo

- [ðŸ•¥] handle the multiple constructors and connecteds either Constructor, create element, inner element
- [x] Handle multiple toasts expand them
- [ ] Handle multiple toasts stack them
- [ ] Add multiple styles of toasts (success, warn, error, default)
- [ ] Add multiple types of toasts (default, action, etc...)

## Idea
Probably it is a better idea add the toast to a container to handle in a better way the reposition of the toasts,
just appended it to the container and remove it from the container when the time expires but I have to refactor all the code
